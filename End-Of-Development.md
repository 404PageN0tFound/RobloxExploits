# RobloxExploits & FreshUI End of Development
Soon (Saturday, 8th February 2025), the development of the aforementioned services will be ceased.
## Why?
Cheats on Roblox are considered bad because they give players an unfair advantage over others, ruining the competitive balance of games, creating a poor experience for legitimate players, and violating Roblox's community standards, which can lead to account bans, and therefore, we are working on creating anticheats for individual Roblox games. [Learn more about Ro AC](https://github.com/Robsploit/Ro-AC). Our last, and final update of RobloxExploits will be soon. About FreshUI, it's last update will also be soon, but most likely later than RE.
